#stub
my extensions for jquery

Purpose
    providing what I am unaware about that is already available (or not)

Interface
    maintain a layer of skin above the guts for legacy and consistency of approach

Philosophy
    consider only things that would seem to naturally fit into jq proper

Inventory (brief)
    use docs to fully describe inside
